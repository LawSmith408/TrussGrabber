# TrussGrabber

A handy script for teaching linear finite elements at the undergraduate level. 
This interactive script lets students construct computational meshes using a simple GUI. 
Mesh information (nodal coordinates and nodal connectivity) are stored automatically after students trace truss elements over a background image.

Also included: 

a .docx file with suggested lab activity
a very simple FEA solver for mesh files produced by TrussGrabber
